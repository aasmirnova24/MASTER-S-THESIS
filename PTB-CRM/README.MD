# CRM: PTB 
PTB (probability to bay) - a model for assessing the probability of a client's response to a cross-sale loan offer. This model allows us to optimize the cost of advertising communications with customers. The statistical unit is the client with whom there was advertising communication. This model is a binary classification. 

## Target
- “1” - a loan was issued after communication, 
- “0” - a loan was not issued after communication.


## DataSet
- Observations: ***545 963***		
- Features: ***1 222***
- Minority class percentage (bad-rate): ***1,28%***
