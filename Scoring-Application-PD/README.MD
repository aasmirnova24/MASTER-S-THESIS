# Scoring: Application
Application PD (CASH) is a model for assessing the probability of default at the stage of issuing a loan (cash loans for individuals). This model allows us to make automated decisions on issuing a loan. The statistical unit is the loan application for which the loan was issued. This model is a binary classification. 

## Target
- “1” - a default event occurred after the loan was issued, 
- “0” - a default event did not occur.


## DataSet
- Observations: ***793 080***		
- Features: ***423***
- Minority class percentage (bad-rate): ***3,60%***
